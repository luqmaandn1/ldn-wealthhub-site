  <p><strong>LDN WealthHub</strong> (“the App”) is published by <strong>Shaikh Mohammad Luqman / DN Group</strong>
  based in Beed, Maharashtra, India (“we”, “us”, or “our”). This policy explains how the App handles information.</p>

  <h2>1) Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No account required.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Your finance data stays on your device.</strong> We do not run servers for your entries.</li>
    <li><strong>No ads. No third-party tracking.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>No media access in the current version.</strong> The App does not request or use camera, photos, microphone, or location permissions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) What the App stores (on your device)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Bills, expenses, categories, budgets, notes</li>
    <li>Investments and goals you add (name, amount, dates, progress)</li>
    <li>Reminder schedules for due dates (if you enable notifications)</li>
    <li>App settings (currency, theme, security lock, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) How data is processed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The App saves data locally on your phone/tablet storage. We do not transmit your entries to our servers.</li>
    <li>Some operating systems may back up app data to your personal cloud (e.g., Google Drive or iCloud) if you enable OS backups. Those services are governed by their own privacy policies.</li>
    <li>If the App fetches exchange rates or updates over the internet, your financial entries are not sent with those requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Permissions used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Notifications</strong> (optional): to remind you about due bills or goals you schedule.</li>
    <li><strong>Network access</strong>: for app updates and optional features (e.g., currency data). We do not use it to upload your entries.</li>
    <li><strong>Biometrics/Passcode</strong> (optional): if you enable an app lock, the App asks the OS to verify you; biometric data never leaves the secure hardware/OS.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>No camera, photos/media, microphone, or location permissions are requested in the current version.</em></p>

  <h2>5) Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the age required by your region). We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

  <h2>6) Data retention & deletion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your entries remain on your device until you delete them.</li>
    <li>You can erase data from within the App (if the feature is available) or by uninstalling the App. If your OS made a cloud backup, delete it from your cloud account as well.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Security</h2>
  <p>We rely on the security of your device and operating system. The App stores data locally and does not implement its own cloud storage or server-side processing. Keep your device updated and protected with a passcode/biometric lock.</p>

  <h2>8) Third-party services</h2>
  <p>We do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs. OS-level services (e.g., app store, crash reporting by the OS, device backups) may process limited technical data under their respective policies.</p>

  <h2>9) International users & legal bases</h2>
  <p>Because your entries stay on your device and are not transmitted to us, we are not the controller of your personal finance data for GDPR/DPDP purposes. Where we process any minimal contact information you provide to us (e.g., when you email us), the legal basis is <em>legitimate interests</em> in providing support and improving the App.</p>

  <h2>10) Your rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete personal data. For data that lives only on your device, you can exercise these rights directly in the App or by deleting the App data on your device. For any information you send us (e.g., support emails), contact us using the details below.</p>

  <h2>11) Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy to reflect the App’s features or legal requirements. Material changes will be highlighted in the App or on this page, with a new effective date.</p>
